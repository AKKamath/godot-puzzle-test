Project in Godot that implements an orb-swapping puzzle game. 

The game consists of 10 rows and 10 columns of orbs of different styles.
Orbs can be swapped in fixed patterns, shown by the lines connecting the different orbs.
Orbs are swapped by either clicking on two connected orbs, or by clicking and dragging and orb across a set of orbs.

Every 10 seconds  (indicated by a rising bar on the right) or if the user presses Space Bar, the right-most column of orbs is removed from the game and counted, with a new column coming in from the left.
Purple orbs with a '+' add one to the count, while blue orbs with '-' remove one from the count. Orange orbs are neutral and do not effect the count.
If the count is negative the column moves downward and is ignored. If the count is positive, the column moves upward count is added to the running score.

After 10 rounds, the game ends and the final score is shown.
